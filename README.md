# 🌾 Agro Nova — Smart Farming Advisor

## 📌 Project Overview
**Agro Nova** is an AI-powered smart farming assistant designed to help farmers get practical, region-based agricultural advice using natural language.  
The web application uses **Generative AI (Gemini)** to provide guidance on crops, irrigation, fertilizers, pest control, and seasonal farming practices in a simple and easy-to-understand format.

This application is intended for:
- Farmers (small and medium scale)
- Agricultural students
- Anyone seeking basic farming guidance using AI

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was developed as part of **Formative Assessment-2 (FA-2)** for the **Generative AI** course.

The main objectives were to:
- Build a functional AI-powered web application
- Optimize and format Gemini outputs for real-world users
- Validate AI responses for usefulness and clarity
- Deploy the application using Streamlit Cloud
- Demonstrate responsible use of generative AI in agriculture

## 🧠 Features
- Region-based farming advice
- Crop recommendations with reasoning
- Water and irrigation guidance
- Fertilizer usage suggestions
- Pest and disease prevention tips
- Simple language suitable for non-technical users

---

## ⚙️ How the App Works
1. The user enters:
   - Location / region
   - Season
   - Crop stage
2. The app sends a structured prompt to the Gemini API
3. Gemini generates formatted agricultural advice
4. The output is displayed clearly on the web interface

---

## 📊 Model Validation
The AI assistant was tested using multiple prompts from different regions such as:
- India
- Canada
- Ghana

Each response was evaluated using a checklist:
- Is the advice region-specific?
- Is the reasoning logical?
- Is the language simple?
- Is the advice safe and practical?

Based on testing, prompts were refined to reduce generic responses and improve accuracy.
